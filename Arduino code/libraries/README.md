This is the needed libaries in order to compile the code.

To use it, simply download the libraries and moved them into your [libraries folder](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).

__NB:__ The libaries folders are not allowed to have any special characters, so rename the libraries to:

* USB\_Host\_Shield\_20
* KalmanFilter

The final structure including the libraies would look like this:

* Arduino/
	* libraries/
		* USB\_Host\_Shield\_20/
		* KalmanFilter/
	* hardware/
		* Balanduino/
			* avr/
			* bootloaders/
			* cores/
			* variants/
			* README.md
			* boards.txt
