This is the Balanduino hardware add-on for the Arduino IDE.

To use it, simply create a folder named hardware inside your sketchbook directory.

Now move the Balanduino directory inside that folder. The final structure including the libraies would look like this:

* Arduino/
	* libraries/
		* USB_Host_Shield_20/
		* KalmanFilter/
	* hardware/
		* Balanduino/
			* avr/
			* bootloaders/
			* cores/
			* variants/
			* README.md
			* boards.txt
